# COVID-19 Trials by SMS
**Help physicians and patients discover COVID-19 clinical trials by texting it to their phone**

By allowing patients, physicians, and caretakers to search for clinical trials by SMS, I hope to:
- Encourage clinical trial participation, especially at a time when information on this disease is so desperately needed
- Give referring physicians more information on where they may want to send their COVID-19 patients for treatment
- Gives patients and caregivers another resource in their search for potential treatment options

**How to Use It:**

Simply text your five digit US ZIP code** to (504) 701-0519 and you will receive a list of clinical trials near you. To filter by keyword, you can send a text starting with "Keywords: " and any subsequent words will be used to narrow your results.

***Only available in the United States for now*
